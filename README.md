<h1 text-align="center">Chat App</h1>
A simple Express build with an object that handles multiple connections to a chat server, handles messaging and a custom feature displaying the user connectio status: online or offline

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Use Node, Express and Vue with socket.io to create a live interactive chat application. We will
continue exploring components, APIs etc with a brief intro to Node and NPM.

We’ll be building most of this in class as an intro to Node. The back end / API will be pretty lightweight, which gives you lots of time to think about other features to include as a more complete application.

Expand on the default functionality / class build. You could add (or finish) the login page / user registration, include a notification message when a user leaves the chat, or add the ability to add a custom avatar per user.

Choose at least one other enhancement - NOT including what’s already in the class build - to
implement ( refer to the documentation @ https://socket.io/ )..
